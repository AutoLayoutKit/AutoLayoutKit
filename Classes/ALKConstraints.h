/**
 `ALKConstraints` is the heart of *AutoLayoutKit*. It provides the user with a
 brief possibility to create `NSLayoutConstraint` sets in a clear and verbose
 way. You don't need to care about the class itself as you are only going to
 use the class name `ALKConstraints` in the first row of each set.
 
 ## Subclassing Notes ##
 
 `ALKConstraints` is not intended for subclassing.
 
 ## Using AutoLayoutKit ##
 
 A default constraint set consists of **four** constraints. It is only when you
 are layouting views that have an intrinsic content size that you only need
 **two** constraint definitions.
 
 Take a look at this "normal" constraint set:
 
    [ALKConstraints layout:self.optionA do:^(ALKConstraints *c) {
      [c set:ALKHeight to:60.f name:kLKHeight];
      [c set:ALKWidth to:60.f name:kLKWidth];
      [c make:ALKRight equalTo:self.optionB s:ALKLeft plus:-10.f];
      [c make:ALKCenterY equalTo:self s:ALKCenterY];
    }];
 
 The first two are setting the height and the width of the View `optionA` while
 the third and the last are aligning the center of `optionA` to the center of
 the superview vertically (`ALKCenterY`) and the right edge of `optionA` to the
 left edge of `optionB` (with a margin of 10.f).
 
 Check the rest of the API to see what you can do using *AutoLayoutKit*.
